## UsageIn dev mode, client and server are running separately as 2 servers.In prod mode, there's only on server that contains client build.```// install modulescd client && npm i && cd ..cd server && npm i && cd ..npm i``````// run dev modenpm run dev```## Demo[purchase-summary.herokuapp.com](https://purchase-summary.herokuapp.com/)## BasicTried to reproduce the official UI, create-react-app for quick start, then ejected and modified webpack configuration to add css-modules and others.SCSS watcher and prettier watcher are enabled on my local IDEA, and configured eslint to work with prettier for syntax auto reformat.## ClientUse proxy to redirect calls to Node serverReduxUsing `redux-thunk` for async call handling.Data FlowThe view `PersistentOrderSummary` is the root component to handle data flow, it connects with Redux and connect data to child Components by using props and callback functions. The others are functional components only render based on received props.## ServerI didn't use mockup data directly in Redux, instead I created a simple Node server and fire async call to simulate normal checkout process, and created routes provides the needed data for incoming request.
